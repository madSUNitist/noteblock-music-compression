/// Builds translational equivalence classes (TECs) for every maximal translatable pattern (MTP)
/// found in the dataset by the SIA algorithm.
///
/// For each MTP (represented by a translation vector `v` and its pattern `P`), this function
/// determines all translation vectors `w` such that `P + w` is entirely contained in the dataset.
/// These `w`s become the TEC's translator set. The TEC is then stored as `⟨P, translators⟩`.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `dataset` - A reference to the vector of points `(tick, pitch)`.
/// * `restrict_dpitch_zero` - If `true`, only translation vectors with zero pitch difference
///   are accepted (purely temporal shifts).
///
/// # Returns
/// A vector of `TranslationalEquivalence` objects, one per distinct MTP (i.e., per non‑zero
/// translation vector `v`). Patterns that have no translators (other than the trivial zero vector)
/// are omitted.
///
/// # Algorithmic notes
/// - For each MTP pattern `P`, the candidate translators are all vectors from the first pattern
///   point `p0` to any point in the dataset. Only those that map the whole `P` into the dataset
///   are kept.
/// - Complexity: `O(m · n)` where `m` is the number of MTPs and `n` is the dataset size.
///   In the worst case `m = O(n²)`.
